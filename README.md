# Pandemic-in-Romania
Data analisys of CoVid situation in Romania.
Using python I tried to see how the vaccination and other things are reflecting  in data and in plots.
For plots I think that smoothed data is more important since we need to see trends and try to find some patterns that reflect from the real situation.While for calculations and precise analisys the raw data is more useful even though it has some irregularities.
